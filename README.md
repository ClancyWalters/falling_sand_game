# Falling Sand Game
My Falling sand game was created for unit COS20007 as the end of semester project (semester 2 2020). The project was made in first year and had to fit certain design criteria that limited the methods I could use to optimize the game. The project has been included as an example project for the unit.

# Falling Sand Game  - Design Report
## Source code and precompiled versions:
I encourage you to download and try the game as it is much easier to understand certain interactions when you can watch them take place. Precompiled versions can be found in [releases](/releases/latest).

## Overview:
For my custom project I intended to create a game in the falling sand game genre. This genre consists of games where materials such as sand, stone, and water are represented on a 2D grid and given actions different materials can perform such as falling. Although not strictly followed, the original concept for performing these actions was the idea of cellular automata and creating complex interactions via simple rules. Some notable examples of this genre are noita, sandspiel, and powder toy.
I chose to create a game in this genre as it seems to lend itself to object oriented design with each tile on the 2D grid being an object and inheritance being used to add functionality to blocks in an extensible manner.
